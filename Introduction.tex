\chapter{Introduction}
In this introductory chapter, the background and applications of optical metrology systems are discussed in Section 1.1. The objectives and major contributions are discussed in Section 1.2, followed by an outline of the thesis given in Section 1.3. 

\section{Introduction}

\section{Objectives}
The objective of the work is to develop smart three-dimensional vision-based inspection system using novel 3D measurement technologies coupled with Deep Learning based analysis.

\section{Scope}


\section{Outline}
Chapter 2 provides a literature review that briefly gives definitions of important concepts and an overview of past research works on three-dimensional shape measurement, besides, the introduction of deep learning applications in machine vision also included. In Chapter 3, current works in three-dimensional measurement techniques such as PMR, TIE, and deconvolution methods will be introduced. Chapter 4 concludes the report and provides a detailed plan for future works.
